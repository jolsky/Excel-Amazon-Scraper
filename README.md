Excel VBA Addin to Scrap Amazon Web Page

-  Download the Addin file

- Now the Addin should work 

## Screenshots

Although the container classname may frequently changes, Amazon usually wraps all the item data in one single div. So in case where the class name has changed, you should look into the web browser for the new name and paste it into the Excel D3 cell.
